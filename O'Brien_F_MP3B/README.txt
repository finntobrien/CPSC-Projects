5) I frequently used chatgpt for troubleshooting errors. It was very helpful in determining loops that were going out of bounds, and errors that I could not explain otherwise. An example of this is that when I was removing players from the player list while iterating over it, issues would arise. I didn't know that it can be troublesome to remove elements of a linked list while iterating over it, but chat gpt taught me that. I also spoke to you for the issue with my loop not breaking.
